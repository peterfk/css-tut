  Rules do not seem to work.

Continue.dev IDE: Rules in .continue/rules may not be invoked automatically; manual selection may be needed, as reflected in user complaints about poor rule application UX.

If your scenario is within Continue.dev, this appears to be a known UX issue, and until updates resolve it, explicit manual selection of rules or direct invocation may be required.
