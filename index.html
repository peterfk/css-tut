        Lynx are medium-sized wild cats known for the characteristic tufts of
        black hair on the tips of their ears and their short, bobbed tails.
        Found in the high-altitude forests of North America, Europe, and Asia,
        their appearance varies with the climate; lynx in colder, northern
        regions have thick, light-colored fur and large, padded paws that act
        like snowshoes, while those in warmer southern climates have shorter,
        darker coats and smaller paws.
