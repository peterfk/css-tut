      <h2>Big Cats</h2>
      <p>
        Big cats are a group of large, powerful felines known for their
        strength, agility, and hunting prowess. They include lions, tigers,
        leopards, jaguars, cheetahs, and more. These magnificent creatures are
        found in various habitats across the world, from savannas and forests to
        mountains and wetlands.

        Lions are majestic predators known for their powerful roars and iconic
        manes. They live in social groups called prides, primarily inhabiting
        African savannas.

        Lynx are medium-sized wild cats known for the characteristic tufts of
        black hair on the tips of their ears and their short, bobbed tails.
        Found in the high-altitude forests of North America, Europe, and Asia,
        their appearance varies with the climate; lynx in colder, northern
        regions have thick, light-colored fur and large, padded paws that act
        like snowshoes, while those in warmer southern climates have shorter,
        darker coats and smaller paws.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tigers, the largest members of the cat family, are renowned for their
        distinctive striped coat and formidable hunting skill. They are
        solitary, territorial predators, native to parts of Asia from the
        Siberian tundra to the Sundarbans mangrove forest.
      </p>

        Leopards are powerful, elusive big cats recognized for their rosette-
        spotted coats and incredible agility. They are solitary hunters that
        climb trees with ease and are found across sub-Saharan Africa and parts
        of Asia, adapting to forests, grasslands, and even mountainous terrain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jaguars are the largest cats in the Americas, instantly recognizable by
        their dark rosettes with central spots. They are powerful swimmers and
        apex predators, roaming rainforests and wetlands from Mexico to northern
        Argentina.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cheetahs are the fastest land animals, capable of reaching speeds up to
        70 mph. They are slender, with a long tail and spotted coat, and are
        primarily found in the savannas and grasslands of Africa.
      </p>
      <p>
        Servals are medium-sized African wild cats known for their distinctive
        long legs, large ears, and spotted golden coat. These elegant hunters
        are specially adapted for catching prey in tall grass, using their
        exceptional hearing and ability to leap up to 3 meters high. Found
        primarily in sub-Saharan Africa, servals prefer areas with good cover
        and proximity to water, where they hunt primarily rodents and birds.

        Cougars, also known as mountain lions or panthers, are large solitary
        felines native to the Americas. They exhibit a tawny coat and a long
        tail, and are renowned for their strength and stealth. Cougars roam
        diverse habitats, from forests and deserts to mountains, and are apex
        predators with a highly specialized hunting strategy that relies on
        ambush and speed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bobcats are adaptable predators found throughout North America. They are
        named for their short, bobbed tail. Their coat can be various shades of
        buff and brown with spots and stripes that act as camouflage. Bobcats
        are skilled hunters, stalking their prey before ambushing it with a
        short chase or pounce.
      </p>
      <p>
        Snow leopards are elusive big cats native to the mountain ranges of
        Central and South Asia. They have thick fur, long tails, and large paws
        that help them navigate their cold, rugged habitat. Snow leopards are
        solitary hunters, primarily preying on mountain ungulates and small
        mammals.
