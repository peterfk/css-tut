          Tigers, the largest members of the cat family, are renowned for their
          distinctive striped coat and formidable hunting skill. They are
          solitary, territorial predators, native to parts of Asia from the
          Siberian tundra to the Sundarbans mangrove forest.

          Leopards are powerful, elusive big cats recognized for their rosette-
          spotted coats and incredible agility. They are solitary hunters that
          climb trees with ease and are found across sub-Saharan Africa and
          parts of Asia, adapting to forests, grasslands, and even mountainous
          terrain.

          Jaguars are the largest cats in the Americas, instantly recognizable
          by their dark rosettes with central spots. They are powerful swimmers
          and apex predators, roaming rainforests and wetlands from Mexico to
          northern Argentina.

          Cheetahs are the fastest land animals, capable of reaching speeds up
          to 70 mph. They are slender, with a long tail and spotted coat, and
          are primarily found in the savannas and grasslands of Africa.

          Snow leopards are elusive big cats native to the mountain ranges of
          Central and South Asia. They have thick fur, long tails, and large
          paws that help them navigate their cold, rugged habitat. Snow leopards
          are solitary hunters, primarily preying on mountain ungulates and
          small mammals.

        <h2>Small Cats</h2>
        <p>
          Lynx are medium-sized wild cats known for the characteristic tufts of
          black hair on the tips of their ears and their short, bobbed tails.
          Found in the high-altitude forests of North America, Europe, and Asia,
          their appearance varies with the climate; lynx in colder, northern
          regions have thick, light-colored fur and large, padded paws that act
          like snowshoes, while those in warmer southern climates have shorter,
          darker coats and smaller paws.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sand cat (<em>Felis margarita</em>) is a small desert-dwelling
          feline adapted to life in some of the harshest arid environments on
          Earth. It sports a pale, sand‑colored coat that provides excellent
          camouflage, large ears that dissipate heat, and thick foot pads that
          protect its paws from hot sand. Despite its diminutive size—about the
          length of a domestic cat—it is a skilled nocturnal hunter, preying on
          rodents, insects, and small reptiles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Servals are medium-sized African wild cats known for their distinctive
          long legs, large ears, and spotted golden coat. These elegant hunters
          are specially adapted for catching prey in tall grass, using their
          exceptional hearing and ability to leap up to 3 meters high. Found
          primarily in sub-Saharan Africa, servals prefer areas with good cover
          and proximity to water, where they hunt primarily rodents and birds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ocelots are small, spotted wild cats native to the Americas, ranging
          from the southern United States through Central America to northern
          Argentina. Their distinctive coat features a pattern of dark rosettes
          and stripes on a yellow‑gold background. Ocelots are nocturnal
          hunters, preying on rodents, birds, and small reptiles, and they
          prefer dense, humid forest habitats where they can move stealthily
          through the underbrush.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bobcats are adaptable predators found throughout North America. They
          are named for their short, bobbed tail. Their coat can be various
          shades of buff and brown with spots and stripes that act as
          camouflage. Bobcats are skilled hunters, stalking their prey before
          ambushing it with a short chase or pounce.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pallas's cats, also known as manuls, are small wild cats native to the
          cold, arid grasslands of Central Asia. They are characterized by their
          flattened faces, low-set ears, and dense, long fur that helps them
          survive in harsh, cold climates.
        </p>
        <p>
          House cats (<em>Felis catus</em>) are small, domesticated felines that
          have shared human homes for thousands of years. Unlike their wild
          relatives, they thrive in domestic settings, forming close bonds with
          people while retaining keen hunting instincts. House cats display a
          wide variety of coat colors and patterns, and their personalities
          range from independent to affectionate lap companions. Whether curled
          on a windowsill or chasing a toy mouse, they bring comfort and
          entertainment to millions worldwide.
