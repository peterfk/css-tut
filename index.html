        Tigers, the largest members of the cat family, are renowned for their
        distinctive striped coat and formidable hunting skill. They are
        solitary, territorial predators, native to parts of Asia from the
        Siberian tundra to the Sundarbans mangrove forest.

        Leopards are powerful, elusive big cats recognized for their rosette-
        spotted coats and incredible agility. They are solitary hunters that

        of Asia, adapting to forests, grasslands, and even mountainous terrain.
